## Overview
This file, "catboost_model.joblib", contains a pre-trained CatBoost regression model. The model is trained to predict sourcing costs based on various product-related features, such as product type, manufacturer, sourcing area, and sourcing channel.

## File Details
- **Filename**: catboost_model.joblib
- **Model Type**: CatBoost Regression
- **File Format**: Joblib (serialized Python object)

## Model Description
The CatBoost model included in this file has been optimized for predicting sourcing costs. It utilizes a gradient boosting framework that works well with categorical data and complex patterns in large datasets.

## Usage
To load and use this model, follow these steps:
1. Ensure that you have Python and the necessary libraries installed, including `catboost` and `joblib`.
2. Use the following Python code to load the model:
   ```python
   from joblib import load
   model = load('catboost_model.joblib')
   predictions = model.predict(data)

## Applications
This model is suitable for:

- Cost prediction tasks in supply chain management.
- Business analytics for manufacturing and production planning.
- Enhancing decision-making processes related to sourcing and procurement.
  
## Notes
- The model's performance depends on the similarity of the new data to the data on which it was trained.
- It is recommended to validate the model's predictions against known outcomes before using it for critical business decisions.
